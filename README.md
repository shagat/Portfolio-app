# PortfolioApp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.3.5.

This is an app that I created for my portfolio and so as to 
learn about Angular. 

Its a very simple app that encompasses some of the features 
that i learned in Angular.

There are three main pages - Home, Works and Contact.

# Home
Its landing page with a scroll down feature that delves more
about me.
Some key features here are:-
  - the typing animation that is created with css and ts.
  - the scrolling slide functionality.

# Works
Its the page where i showcase some of the pojects that i have
worked on.

# Contact
Its a page where there are information that will help people 
who wants to reach me.
